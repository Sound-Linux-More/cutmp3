This is a small program to edit mp3 (and mp2) files without quality loss.
Playback is realized via mpg123, so be sure to have it installed or at least
have a symlink to your favorite mp3 playing program.
I recommend a symlink to mpg321 which works better!
You can mark beginning and end of a segment with 'a' and 'b' and save the
segment with 's'.
Using a timetable or direct times with VBR files delivers exact(!)
results.
cutmp3 even works with files bigger than 2 GB!

If you want a working graphical software you can try mp3directcut,
which runs fairly well in WINE after I asked the author about a WINEd version.

*** Compiling cutmp3 ***

- If you have readline-devel or similar installed on your system:

$ make

- If you don't:
  There is a self-contained minimalistic line editor included as a git
  submodule. Kudos to antirez: https://github.com/antirez/linenoise
  To check out and use:

$ git submodule update --init
$ make LNOISE=yes

- Installing to /usr/local/bin:

$ make install

..or to /usr/bin with

$ make install PREFIX=/usr

Please read "USAGE" on detailed info on how to use cutmp3.
