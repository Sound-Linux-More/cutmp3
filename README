This is a small program to edit mp3 (and mp2) files without quality loss.
Playback is realized via mpg123, so be sure to have it installed or at least
have a symlink to your favorite mp3 playing program.
I recommend a symlink to mpg321 which works better!
You can mark beginning and end of a segment with 'a' and 'b' and save the
segment with 's'.
Using a timetable or direct times with VBR files delivers exact(!)
results.
cutmp3 even works with files bigger than 2 GB!

If you want a working graphical software you can try mp3directcut,
which runs fairly well in WINE after I asked the author about a WINEd version.

Compile cutmp3 with a simple
(you will need readline-devel or similar!)

$ make

install it to /usr/local/bin with

$ make install

..or to /usr/bin with

$ PREFIX=/usr make install

Please read "USAGE" on detailed info on how to use cutmp3.

If you experience any trouble with a specific file, please contact me!

Maybe this program is useful for you.
